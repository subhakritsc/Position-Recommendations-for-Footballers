# Position Recommendations for Footballers Using Python and Scikit-Learn


**[My Project Notebook](https://github.com/subhakritsc/Position-Recommendations-for-Footballers/blob/main/Football%20Position%20Selection%20Test.ipynb)**


## Objective

This project aims to help football players and coaches select the most suitable playing position for a player based on their physical attributes and skills. Using machine learning techniques, the model selects and ranks the best positions for a player, assisting in optimal team selection and player development.


## Dataset

The project uses two datasets for model training and testing:

1. **[EA Sports FC 24 Complete Player Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/ea-sports-fc-24-complete-player-dataset)** by **[Stefano Leone](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992)**: Used for **Training** the model.

2. **[EA SPORTS FC 25 DATABASE, RATINGS AND STATS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nyagami/ea-sports-fc-25-database-ratings-and-stats)** by **[Davis Nyagami](https://www.kaggle.com/nyagami)**:Used for **Testing** the model.
